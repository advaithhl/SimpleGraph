SimpleGraph is a project meant to serve as a simple, yet feature-rich implementation of the Graph ADT in Java.
There are various types of graphs; undirected graph, directed graph, weighted graph etc.

At the time of writing, the weighted graph implementation works perfectly. Dijkstra's algorithm has been incorporated for various functions.

However, SimpleGraph is still at its infancy, and it has miles yet to go to reach the type of project I imagined.
